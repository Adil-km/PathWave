# PathWave

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Coconut

### Team Members
- Member 1: Adil KM - Farook College, Calicut
- Member 2: Shamil K - Farook College, Calicut

### Project Description
PathWave takes an image of a pothole and turns it into a unique 20 second of music. Because who said road damage can't sound beautiful?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Path holes are everywhere - but no one has ever asked what they sound like. We have been looking at them all wrong. They're not ugly holes, they're hidden music waiting to be heard.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Snap a photo of a path hole and upload it. Our system analyzes the image and turns it into a beat. It is completely unnecessary, but you have never heard anything like it. We didn‚Äôt solve a real problem. But we definitely made some noiseüòÅ.
