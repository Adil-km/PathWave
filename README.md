# PathWave üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Coconut


### Team Members
- Member 2: Adil km - Farook College, Calicut

### Project Description
PathWave takes an image of a pothole and turns it into a custom piece of music. Because who said road damage can't sound beautiful?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Potholes are everywhere - but no one has ever asked what they sound like. We have been looking at them all wrong. They're not ugly holes, they're hidden music waiting to be heard.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Snap a photo of a pothole and upload it. Our system analyzes the image and turns it into a beat. It is completely unnecessary, but you have never heard anything like it.
